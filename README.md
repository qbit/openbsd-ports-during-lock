openbsd-ports-during-lock
=========================

A place to put updated ports during lock. This repo is only for ports that are already in the tree, and only while the ports tree is locked. You should be dropping diffs made with "$ cvs diff -Nup" here, not the full ports structure. This repo created because I will surely be blasting away my installs for testing and would prefer not to lose my work.

Ask if you want write access to this tree. Please add diffs you drop here to the UNLOCK file so we know who is reponsible for what (and so you remember to commit after unlock).
